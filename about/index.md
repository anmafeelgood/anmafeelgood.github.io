<h2>Everyone has a history, and we have one too.!</h2>

***How*** we started?

We were sharing our recent incidents with each other about the anxiety. So, to fight against it, we thought of creating a platform that brings us together and share the information that is beneficial for us to win over anxiety.

With the help of this website and our application, we will try our best to make you feel good and help you to win over anxiety.

Once you adapt these small changes in your life, you will notice a big change in your life. You have more energy, enthusiasm, strength, confidence to work on things. Your failure starts turning into success.
