**Your Time Will Come**

Kenya is two hours ahead of Nigeria, but it does not mean that Nigeria is slow, and it does not mean that Kenya is faster than Nigeria. Both countries are working based on their own "Time Zone."

Some one is still single..Someone got married and 'waited' ten years before having a child, there is another who had had a baby within one year after marriage.

Someone graduated at the age of 22, yet waited 5 years before securing a job; and there is another who graduated at the age of 27 and secured employment just after national service.

Joyce Meyer started her own ministry at age 41 and still alive today at 71 years old.

Someone became CEO at the age of 25 and died at the age of 50 while another became a CEO at the age of 50 and lived to 90 years.

Everyone worked based on their ***'Time Zone'..***
Some people have everything that work fast for them. Work in your “time zone”.

Colleagues, friends, associates, younger one(s) might "seem" to go ahead of you. Don't envy them, it's their 'Time Zone.'. Yours is coming soon. Hold on, be strong, and stay true to yourself. All things shall work together for your good. You’re not late… you’re on **TIME!**
